"""Data limits: none when Tag Signal runs locally, hard caps only for a public demo.

Run on someone's own computer (standalone, a local Signal Hub, or an internal company deployment), Tag Signal has no
built-in limit on file size, rows or columns; memory is the limit. A public demo sets ``SIGNAL_PUBLIC=1`` (Signal
Hub's public Docker image does), and then the caps below protect the shared server. Every cap lives here.
